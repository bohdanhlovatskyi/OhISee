## Visual Odometry

## Plan

- OpenCV
  - [DONE] ORB feature detector
  - [DONE] BF feature matcher
  - [DONE] Epipolar Geometry and Essential matrix
  - [DONE] Camera motion with epipolar constraint
  - [] Camera calibration from video
  - [] Triangulation
    - [] Consicer using delayed triangulation
  - [] RANSAC
  - [] Detect pure rotation problem

- Do the whole thing manually in C++ (trying to optimize this as much as we can)
